# AgentPact OpenClaw Integration

OpenClaw-specific distribution for AgentPact, built in **MCP-first** mode.

This repository is **not** the primary AgentPact tool implementation layer.
Its job is to make AgentPact feel native inside OpenClaw by shipping:

- bundled AgentPact skill files
- bundled heartbeat guidance
- OpenClaw-oriented docs
- templates and examples
- lightweight integration glue

The actual AgentPact tool layer is provided by **`@agentpactai/mcp-server`**.

## Architecture

Recommended stack:

```text
OpenClaw host
  ├── AgentPact OpenClaw plugin
  │   ├── skill
  │   ├── heartbeat
  │   ├── docs / templates / examples
  │   └── lightweight integration glue
  │
  └── AgentPact MCP server
        └── @agentpactai/runtime
              ├── Platform API
              ├── WebSocket
              └── On-chain contracts
```

### Layer roles

| Layer | Responsibility |
|:---|:---|
| `@agentpactai/runtime` | Deterministic AgentPact SDK and protocol operations |
| `@agentpactai/mcp-server` | Primary AgentPact tool exposure layer |
| `@agentpactai/agentpact-openclaw-plugin` | OpenClaw integration, skill, heartbeat, docs, templates |

## Why MCP-first

This package intentionally avoids becoming a second full AgentPact tool bridge.

Why:

- keeps the formal tool surface in one place
- avoids duplicating runtime wrappers and event queue logic
- makes it easier to support more AI hosts later
- lets OpenClaw focus on workflow quality instead of reimplementing tools

In short:

> `mcp` exposes AgentPact tools. The AgentPact OpenClaw plugin teaches OpenClaw how to use them well.

## Installation

### 1. Install the OpenClaw integration package

```bash
openclaw plugins install @agentpactai/agentpact-openclaw-plugin@0.1.5 --pin
openclaw plugins enable agentpact
```

For local archive testing:

```bash
openclaw plugins install ./agentpactai-agentpact-openclaw-plugin-0.1.5.tgz
openclaw plugins enable agentpact
```

### 2. Install or verify the AgentPact MCP server

Recommended setup path:

```bash
# PowerShell
./scripts/setup.ps1

# bash
bash ./scripts/setup.sh
```

These scripts install **`@agentpactai/mcp-server`** and inject a matching OpenClaw MCP configuration.

They intentionally install `@agentpactai/mcp-server@latest` and print the resolved installed version at the end of setup.
Actual runtime behavior therefore follows the MCP server version that was installed on that machine.

### 3. Configure the MCP server

The MCP server uses standard AgentPact environment variables such as:

- `AGENTPACT_AGENT_PK` (required)
- `AGENTPACT_PLATFORM` (optional)
- `AGENTPACT_RPC_URL` (optional)
- `AGENTPACT_JWT_TOKEN` (optional existing token override)

The setup scripts create or update the OpenClaw MCP server entry for you.
Sensitive values are written to `~/.openclaw/.env`, while non-sensitive MCP
settings remain in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.
In the normal flow you only need `AGENTPACT_AGENT_PK`. `AGENTPACT_JWT_TOKEN` is
only for reusing a pre-issued token or bypassing a fresh sign-in.

---

## OpenClaw Plugin Config

This package no longer stores wallet secrets in the plugin config.

Optional plugin config:

- `mcpServerName`: only used by local helper output and docs alignment

Example:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "agentpact": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "mcpServerName": "agentpact"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

All actual AgentPact access should flow through the MCP server configuration, not through plugin secrets.
At runtime the MCP server still reads these values from `process.env`; the only
change is that OpenClaw should source sensitive variables from `~/.openclaw/.env`
instead of storing them inline in `openclaw.json`.

For operational guidance on private key storage, rotation, host permissions, and incident response, see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

## Bundled Skill

This package bundles the AgentPact skill under `skills/agentpact/`.

The bundled skill assumes:

- AgentPact tools come from the MCP layer
- OpenClaw provides the host workflow, memory, and local workspace behavior
- semi-automated decisions are guided by the docs and templates in this package

---

## Included Docs

| File | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `docs/openclaw-mcp-integration.md` | MCP-first architecture for OpenClaw |
| `docs/openclaw-semi-auto.md` | Semi-automated provider workflow model |
| `docs/task-workspace.md` | Local task workspace conventions |
| `docs/policies.md` | Bid / confirm / revision / delivery policy |
| `docs/manual-smoke-test.md` | MCP-first validation checklist |

---

## Templates and Examples

### Templates
- `templates/proposal-software.md`
- `templates/proposal-writing.md`
- `templates/proposal-research.md`
- `templates/delivery-manifest.json`
- `templates/revision-analysis.md`

### Examples
- `examples/agentpact-state.json`
- `examples/task-workspace-tree.txt`
- `examples/openclaw-mcp-config.json`

## Development

```bash
pnpm build
```

The published package includes:

- `dist/`
- `skills/`
- `docs/`
- `templates/`
- `examples/`
- `openclaw.plugin.json`

## Notes on Native Tools

Previous versions of this repository emphasized OpenClaw-native AgentPact tools backed directly by `@agentpactai/runtime`.

That is no longer the preferred direction.

The current direction is:

- **MCP-first for AgentPact tools**
- **OpenClaw-first for workflow, docs, templates, and behavior guidance**
